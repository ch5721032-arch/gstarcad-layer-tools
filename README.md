# GstarCAD Layer Tools 🎨

A curated collection of layer management tools for CAD software — designed to rename, freeze, lock, and organize layers in seconds, keeping every drawing clean and consistent.

Whether you use **GSTARCAD**, AutoCAD, ZWCAD, or BricsCAD, these scripts can help you work smarter.

## About

Messy layers cause most drafting problems — objects on the wrong layer, missing standards, or dozens of unused layers in every file. This repository provides free, open-source tools to batch-clean and standardize layers across your drawings.

All scripts are tested with **[GSTARCAD](https://www.gstarcad.net)** and major DWG-based CAD platforms. They work out of the box with minimal configuration.

## Scripts Overview

### AutoLISP Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `layer-rename.lsp` | Batch rename layers with find & replace rules |
| `layer-freeze-by-pattern.lsp` | Freeze layers matching a name pattern (e.g. `HIDDEN-*`) |
| `layer-lock-paper.lsp` | Lock all layers in paper space viewports |
| `layer-clean.lsp` | Purge unused layers and merge duplicates |
| `layer-export.lsp` | Export layer list with colors and linetypes to CSV |

### Python Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `layer-audit.py` | Audit a folder of DWG files for layer standard violations |
| `layer-report.py` | Generate a layer usage report per drawing |

## Quick Start

### AutoLISP

1. Download the `.lsp` file you need
2. In your CAD software, run `APPLOAD` command
3. Select the downloaded `.lsp` file and click Load
4. Type the corresponding command name to run

### Python

```bash
pip install ezdxf
python scripts/layer-audit.py ./drawings
```

## How to Use

### Loading AutoLISP Scripts in GSTARCAD

1. Open GSTARCAD (or your preferred CAD software)
2. Type `APPLOAD` in the command line
3. Browse to the script file and click **Load**
4. Check the command prompt for the run command

Each script includes header comments with usage instructions. For more [tutorials and guides](https://www.gstarcad.net/cad/), visit the official learning center.

### Example: Clean Unused Layers

```lisp
;; Load the script: APPLOAD → layer-clean.lsp
;; Run command: LCLEAN
;; Review the list → confirm → layers purged!
```

## Compatibility

All scripts are tested and verified on:
